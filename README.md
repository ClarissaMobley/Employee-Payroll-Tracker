# Employee Payroll Tracker

I created this project with Javascript to showcase the use of functions and variables. The website will first prompt you with your first name, last name, then salary. After that, it will ask if you'd like to add more. If you would like to cancel, a table of employee's data will show up. In the console, you'll get information like the salary average, number of employees, and a random employee winner.
